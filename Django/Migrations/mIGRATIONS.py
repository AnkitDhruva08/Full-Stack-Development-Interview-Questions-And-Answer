Nice one 👍 This is a fundamental Django question that confuses many people.
Let’s break it down super clearly:

🔹 makemigrations

Command:

python manage.py makemigrations


What it does:

Looks at your models.py.

Detects changes (new model, new field, changed field, deleted field).

Generates a new migration file inside your app’s migrations/ folder (0001_initial.py, 0002_add_field.py, etc.).

But it does not apply anything to the database yet.

👉 Think of makemigrations as writing down the plan for what should change in the database.

🔹 migrate

Command:

python manage.py migrate


What it does:

Reads the migration files created by makemigrations.

Applies those changes to the actual database schema.
(Creates tables, adds columns, removes columns, etc.)

Also updates a special table django_migrations in your DB to track which migrations are applied.

👉 Think of migrate as executing the plan and updating the real database.

🔑 Difference in One Line

makemigrations = create migration files (plans).

migrate = apply migration files to the database (execute plans).

🔹 Example

Add a field to a model:

class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()   # new field


Run:

python manage.py makemigrations


Output:

Migrations for 'myapp':
  myapp/migrations/0002_employee_age.py


👉 A migration file 0002_employee_age.py is created (but DB unchanged).

Run:

python manage.py migrate


Output:

Applying myapp.0002_employee_age... OK


👉 Database is updated: a new column age is added to the employee table.

⚡ Memory Tip:

makemigrations = "make the recipe 🍲"

migrate = "cook the dish 👨‍🍳"

Do you want me to also explain what’s inside a migration file (so you know exactly what Django is writing when you do makemigrations)?
