ðŸ”¹ What is DSA?

DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the foundation of computer science.

Data Structures â†’ Ways to organize and store data (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, HashMaps).

Algorithms â†’ Step-by-step methods to solve problems (e.g., Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Graph Traversals).

ðŸ”¹ Categories of Algorithms in DSA

2. Searching Algorithms

Used to find elements in data structures.

Linear Search

Binary Search

3. Divide & Conquer Algorithms

Break problem â†’ Solve subproblems â†’ Combine.
