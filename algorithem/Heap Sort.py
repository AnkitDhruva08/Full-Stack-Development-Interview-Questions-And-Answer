"""
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.

A heap is a special kind of binary tree where:

In a Max Heap, every parent node â‰¥ its children.

In a Min Heap, every parent node â‰¤ its children.

ðŸ‘‰ For ascending order, we usually use a Max Heap.

ðŸ”¹ How Heap Sort Works

Build a max heap from the input array.

Swap the root (largest element) with the last element of the heap.

Reduce the heap size by 1.

Heapify the root again to maintain the max-heap property.

Repeat until the heap size is 1.

Example: [4, 10, 3, 5, 1]

Step 1: Build max heap â†’ [10, 5, 3, 4, 1]

Step 2: Swap root with last â†’ [1, 5, 3, 4, 10]

Step 3: Heapify â†’ [5, 4, 3, 1, 10]

Step 4: Swap root with last unsorted â†’ [1, 3, 4, 5, 10]

Step 5: Continue â†’ [1, 3, 4, 5, 10] âœ… Sorted
