# üìù Problem Set (for Abstract Methods Practice)
# Problem 1: Shape Area Calculator

# Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method area().

# Implement subclasses: Circle, Rectangle, Square.

# Each subclass should implement its own area() method.

# Write a program that takes a list of shapes and prints their areas.

# Problem 2: Vehicle Sound System

# Define an abstract class Vehicle with an abstract method sound().

# Implement subclasses: Car, Bike, Truck.

# Each should print a different horn sound (Beep, Vroom, Honk).

# Write a function that accepts a list of vehicles and calls their sound() methods.

# Problem 3: Employee Salary Calculator

# Create an abstract class Employee with an abstract method calculate_salary().

# Subclasses: FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee, Freelancer.

# Each calculates salary differently:

# FullTime: fixed monthly salary.

# PartTime: hourly rate √ó hours worked.

# Freelancer: project rate.

# Input: A list of employees, output their salaries.

# Problem 4: Payment Gateway (Mini)

# Like your earlier example:

# Abstract class Payment with pay(amount) method.

# Subclasses: CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, UPIPayment.

# Create objects and process payments for different amounts.

# Problem 5: Animal Sound Zoo

# Define an abstract class Animal with make_sound().

# Subclasses: Dog, Cat, Cow.

# Each prints its own sound.

# Write a function zoo_sound(animals) that loops over animals and calls make_sound().
