# Roadmap

The BuildBridges roadmap defines the strategic milestones to evolve from an internal prototype into a full-fledged platform that supports **agentic web transformation** at scale.

---

## 🗓️ Phase 1 — Foundation (Q4 2025)
**Goal:** Establish the core analysis system and public visibility.

- [x] Build AI + Lighthouse hybrid audit pipeline  
- [x] Design Agent Readiness Index (ARI) framework  
- [x] Launch early web dashboard (React + FastAPI backend)  
- [x] Integrate authentication & role-based access control  
- [ ] Launch **Public API** for external agentic audits  
- [ ] Publish MkDocs developer documentation  
- [ ] Add **basic scoring visualizations** (charts + heatmaps)

---

## 🚀 Phase 2 — Remediation & Automation (Q1–Q2 2026)
**Goal:** Move from analysis → action through automated remediation.

- [ ] Add **Remediation Engine** to suggest & auto-fix web issues  
- [ ] Integrate with **GitHub & CI/CD hooks** for continuous audits  
- [ ] Enable **webhook callbacks** for analysis results  
- [ ] Add **AI-powered explanation layer** (how to fix issues)  
- [ ] Provide **downloadable ARI reports (PDF, JSON)**  

---

## 🧠 Phase 3 — Intelligence & Personalization (Q3 2026)
**Goal:** Make BuildBridges adaptive and self-learning.

- [ ] Develop **adaptive learning models** for ARI scoring  
- [ ] Use **feedback loops** to improve recommendations  
- [ ] Support **industry-specific scoring templates** (e.g., healthcare, e-commerce, SaaS)  
- [ ] Enable **AI chatbot integration** within dashboard (agent-assisted remediation)  
- [ ] Add **semantic graph layer** for multi-site interconnections  

---

## 🌍 Phase 4 — Ecosystem Expansion (Q4 2026–2027)
**Goal:** Evolve BuildBridges into a network-driven intelligence layer.

- [ ] Launch **Partner Program** for agencies & web consultants  
- [ ] Create **BuildBridges CLI** for local agentic audits  
- [ ] Add **browser extension** for instant ARI scoring  
- [ ] Introduce **community leaderboard** of agent-ready sites  
- [ ] Integrate **Agentic Discovery Hub** (global registry of AI-readable sites)

---

## 🔮 Long-Term Vision
BuildBridges aims to become the **standard of trust** for AI-agent web compatibility — similar to what Lighthouse did for performance or WCAG did for accessibility.

> “In the near future, every website won’t just be SEO-ready — it will be **Agent-Ready**.  
> BuildBridges is paving the road to that future.”
