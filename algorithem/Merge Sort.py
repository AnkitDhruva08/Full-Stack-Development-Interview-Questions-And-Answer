ðŸ”¹ Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm.
It divides the array into smaller parts, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

ðŸ”¹ How Merge Sort Works

Divide â†’ Split the array into two halves

Conquer â†’ Recursively sort both halves

Example: [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]

Split â†’ [38, 27, 43, 3] and [9, 82, 10]

Keep splitting until single elements â†’ [38] [27] [43] [3] [9] [82] [10]

Merge sorted pairs â†’ [27, 38] [3, 43] [9, 82] [10]

Merge again â†’ [3, 27, 38, 43] and [9, 10, 82]

Final merge â†’ [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82] âœ…
